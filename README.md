A Django-powered platform that helps users **discover nearby local businesses** and connect with them directly. Built to promote local commerce and empower neighborhood entrepreneurs, **VocalForLocal** is a simple tool with a big mission.

## 💡 Why?

> Why not support local businesses?  
> During the rush of e-commerce and big chains, small local vendors often go unnoticed.  
> I built this app so people can just **search**, **discover**, and **reach out** to stores near them — within seconds.
